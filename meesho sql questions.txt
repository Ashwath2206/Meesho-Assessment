A company have the transaction data for its ecommerce site stored in a table which contains columns/fields (users_id ,transaction_id, timestamp ) 


For users acquired in a given week (first transaction for that user was in that week), week starting 29st Sep 2022. Find the D+7, D+30 and D+60 retained transactors. 

D+i → Retained transactors are users who transacted atleast i days after there onboarding date

Write a query to get the desired output
